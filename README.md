# Hi, I am Sai ğŸ‘‹

I graduated in 2015 with my Masters in Financial Mathematics and worked for 6 in years in various finance and quant roles at Credit Suisse and JPMorgan. After learning Python to automate processes and improve data analysis, I decided to pivot my career towards software development. I wrapped up a mini-batch at theÂ [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)Â in fall 2020 and now work fulltime at [Cadre](https://cadre.com/)
